The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software. All of our projects, tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application security. 

Chapters are led by local leaders in accordance with the [Chapters Policy](/www-policy/operational/chapters). Financial contributions should only be made online using the authorized online donation button. 

Everyone is welcome and encouraged to participate in our [Projects](/projects/), [Local Chapters](/chapters/), [Events](/events/), [Online Groups](https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.com/){:target='_blank'}, and [Community Slack Channel](https://owasp.slack.com/){:target='_blank'}. We especially encourage diversity in all our initiatives. OWASP is a fantastic place to learn about application security, to network, and even to build your reputation as an expert.
